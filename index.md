# A Gap Year: Does it make any difference?

Have you ever thought about the definition of yourself? How can you describe your personality? What about your main passion or everything that makes you the person you are.

Just imagine you are a mix of the five people you spend the most time with, those five things you spend the most time doing, or the five central beliefs that drive your behavior. 

So why not take the opportunity to meet with new people who are smarter, more exciting, or just different than you. The chance to do new things or be open to new beliefs that can change your future life.

As a student, probably, you have never done something significant for yourself. Indeed, you have been surrounded by the same people for years in a comfortable bubble, so you have a single perspective of life.

Maybe you are influenced by your parents or someone else, but are you going to wait to be a professional to discover it?

Right now is the best time to figure out. Take a year off, get a real job where the stuff you do matters, give you the chance to find out your passion, or the opportunity to confirm that your decision will make you happy.

## A World of opportunities

Without a doubt, higher education is valuable, but it only represents a part of your life. Your occupation might be very different from what you are studying now.

Maybe, in your opinion, the university will give you a whole life perspective, so as graduated, you will know what way to follow to be successful.

I don't agree with that. Schools don't care about your motivation, or if your career choice was right or not, they get paid either way. 

No risk, no reward - and the risk you are going to take at this age with zero responsibility is minimum.
A gap year is not a vacation, but just a period away from the classrooms, grades, and exams that have defined your education until this point.

In that sense, many opportunities are waiting for you:

1. **Discover your passion**: Are you interested in a particular work area? An entry-level job is a great way to see what to expect about a profession, and while you are inside, make sure to network. Build contacts, ask questions, and learn everything you can about a career trajectory in the field.

2. **Get the money**: There is a value in taking the year to work, earn money, and save to do everything you dream. Finally, this is a life experience that you don't have by watching TV in the comfortable sofa of your parents' house.

3. **Surpass your weaknesses**: When you lack resources, you must become more resourceful, so if you are shy, use your time to learn public speaking. What about traveling to a place where nobody speaks in your language, you will have to communicate and be outgoing. Whatever was your weakness, it will have a way to work it out.

4. **Volunteering**: If you are motivated to live a valuable growing experience, volunteering in community, charity, a non-profit or activist group can help you to open your life perspective while you are working in something significant to you.

5. **Hit the road**: Go for your trip of dreams. Participate in a program abroad, pick a destination based on your intended career, or pick a place based on your main motivations.

6. **Learn a new language**: Go for an immersive travel experience or if you can't travel, meet with foreign people. Learn about their cultures, characters, and differences. In a globalized world, idioms are the key to success in any field of work.

7. **Time for a break**: Until now, you have been following the rules, maybe it has been a stressful period, and you need a break to recharge your motivation. Don't be afraid about deciding never to go back to education. This statement is a misconception because, according to the American Gap Association, students who took a Gap Year did return to college within a year.


In consequence, this is an invitation of self-discovery, life-changing exploration, and a unique chance to have the time to dip deep and uncover what you want most in your life.

Believe me or not, after this experience, you will be full of energy and revitalized, with a significant focus on your future and more knowledgeable about yourself.

Remember the fast passing of time. You are so young to start to have regrets, so enjoy this moment and try to make this world better for you and everyone.
