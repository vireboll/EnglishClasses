# A Gap Year: Does it make any difference?

Have you ever thought about the definition of yourself? How can you describe your personality? What about your main passion or everything that makes you the person you are.

Just imagine you are a mix of the five people you spend the most time with, those five things you spend the most time doing, or the five central beliefs that drive your behavior. 

So why not take the opportunity to meet with new people who are smarter, more exciting, or just different than you. The chance to do new things or be open to new beliefs that can change your future life.

As a student, probably, you have never done something significant for yourself. Indeed, you have been surrounded by the same people for years in a comfortable bubble, so you have a single perspective of life.

A gap year is not a vacation, but just a period away from the classrooms, grades, and exams that have defined your education until this point.

In that sense, many opportunities are waiting for you:

1. **Discover your passion**: Are you interested in a particular work area? An entry-level job is a great way to see what to expect about a profession, and while you are inside, make sure to network. Build contacts, ask questions, and learn everything you can about a career trajectory in the field.

2. **Get the money**: There is a value in taking the year to work, earn money, and save to do everything you dream. Finally, this is a life experience that you don't have by watching TV in the comfortable sofa of your parents' house.
